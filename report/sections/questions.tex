\section{Questions for further discussion}
Data from previous years can be used to find seasonal trends in the number of patients for each condition. Knowing seasonal trends will allow the clinic to anticipate changes in patient numbers and prepare for them. Is data available from previous years?

This year, 731 patients were 42 years old. For comparison, the next most common age was 31 with 246 patients. E. Medelsvensson saw almost 90\% of these patients, and only these patients. Are there ways to more evenly distribute the 42 year old patients among the doctors to ease E. Medelsvensson's work load? Are the clinic's marketing strategies geared towards 42 year olds, and can they be applied to other ages to achieve the same success?
