\section{Questions for further discussion}
Data from previous years can be used to find seasonal trends in the number of patients for each condition. Knowing seasonal trends will allow the clinic to anticipate changes in patient numbers and prepare for them. Is data available from previous years?

In 2005, 731 patients were 42 years old. For comparison, the next most common age was 31 with 246 patients. E. Medelsvensson saw almost 90\% of these patients, and only these patients. Are there ways to more evenly distribute the 42 year old patients among the doctors to ease E. Medelsvensson's workload? Are the clinic's marketing strategies geared towards 42 year olds, and can they be applied to other ages to achieve the same success?

Since each patient shows up once in the data set (except for 17 patients whose data is duplicated twice in the data set, indicating an error in the data collection process) it's difficult to judge patient outcomes and measure the effectiveness of the clinic's services. How can the clinic collect patient outcome data? For example, can the clinic follow up with patients and get a rating of their experience at the clinic?
