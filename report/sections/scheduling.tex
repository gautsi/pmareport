\section{Smarter scheduling}
\subsection{Analysis}
PMA can be smarter about scheduling. Over the year, 563 appointments were scheduled for less time than the shortest appointment duration for that condition. In fact, 249 times multiple appointments with the same doctor were scheduled for the same time.

\subsection{Effect on the business} Poor scheduling means patient annoyance at longer wait times and increased stress on doctors, both of which can lead to fewer patients for the clinic.

\subsection{A solution} I've developed a statistical model that predicts appointment duration from the age and condition of a patient. Tested on the data set, the model predicts within 5 minutes of the actual duration for 95\% of appointments. Using my model to inform scheduling will reduce waiting times for patients and the strain on doctors of attending to multiple patients at once.
